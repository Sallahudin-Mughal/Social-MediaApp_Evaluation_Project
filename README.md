## Documentation

### Project Plan: 

We started working on the project on April 16. First, we chose how the app would look and planned what features it would have. Then, we made the app so users could log in safely, see posts, and keep scrolling to see more posts. We also made sure users could leave comments and interact with each other. We finished everything on April 27 after making sure everything worked well and fixing any problems we found.

We wrote down all the things the app needed to do before we started making it. We made sure to do everything we wrote down, like letting users log in and showing posts on the screen. We also made sure people could comment on posts and do other things we said the app would do.

We wrote the code neatly and put it in folders so it's easy to understand. We used names for things that make sense and wrote notes in the code to explain how it works.

We made sure the app looks good and works well on phones and computers so everyone can use it easily.
